Question 2:
Given a string a, find the longest palindromic
substring contained in a. Your function definition
should look like question2(a), and return a string.

Edge Cases:
An empty string will return itself, as will a string
with only one character.
A string with no palindromes will return an empty string.

I plan on eliminating spaces and special characters
in order to account for longer, more complex palindromic
phrases like "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama."
