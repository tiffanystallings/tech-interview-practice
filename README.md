# Tech Interview Practice
This is just a collection of technical interview practice problems posed by Udacity as part
of their Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree program.

## Installation
Using Git Bash:
`git clone http://github.com/tiffanystallings/tech-interview-practice.git`

## Requirements
This program requires Python 3 to run.

## Usage
Each file can be run individually for each solution, or solutions.py can be run for all
solutions at once. Explanations.txt contains all explanations of the tought process
and why I came to each solution.

All files will need to be run in the CLI.
`python solutions.py`

## Contributions
As this is part of my course curriculum and also where I plan on keeping any future practice
questions, I won't be taking any contributions to this repository.
